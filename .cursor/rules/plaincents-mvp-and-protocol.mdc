# PlainCents: MVP Gate & Cursor Protocol

## Build order
- Build up to **MVP stage first** (Cursor Pro = main IDE/coder), then complete polish. Get structure right before pipeline/UI.

## Cursor Session 1 (every project)
1. Create repo + open in Cursor
2. Create the **exact folder tree** from PRD/BuildPlan
3. Add: `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `config.py` skeleton, DB schema file skeleton
4. **Do not build models or UI yet**
5. First prompt: *"Read the attached PRD + BuildPlan. Do not write code yet. Summarize the architecture in 8–12 bullets and list the Phase 0 files we must create first. Wait for my go-ahead before generating any pipeline/model code."*
6. Prevents architectural drift.

## MVP = Resume-safe definition
- GitHub link is clean and reproducible
- Demo/deployed link works publicly
- Metrics are reproducible and defensible in 2 sentences
- Bullets can safely move to past tense
- **Metrics must be explainable under questioning:** What does this metric measure? What are its limitations? Why is it still meaningful?

## PlainCents MVP gate (End of Phase 6)
Flip to "Built" when **all** are true:
- `python main.py` runs clean
- All 6 SQLite tables populated
- UPSERT is idempotent (run twice, no duplicates)
- `forecast_vs_actual` has rows
- PowerBI export CSVs generated
- K-Means held-out accuracy printed
- Random Forest forecast metric printed
- README explains 3-step run process
